"""Regression guard for the existing PaddleMaterials public import surface.

LiFlow registers extra Datasets, Models, Metrics and Predictors through the
public ``__init__`` files.  Every incremental registration in this PR must keep
the pre-existing public symbols importable, so this baseline is protected by a
dedicated test that runs after every registration task.
