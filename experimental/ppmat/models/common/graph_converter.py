    This tool identifies neighboring atoms within a cutoff radius for each atom in a

        cutoff (float, optional): Cutoff radius (in Ångström) for neighborhood search.
            Defaults to 5.0.
        pbc (tuple[int, int, int], optional):Periodic boundary conditions along x/y/z
            axes. Each element 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Defaults to (1, 1, 1).
        num_cpus (Optional[int], optional): Number of CPU cores for parallel processing:
            - None: Auto-detect all available cores (recommended)
            - Positive integer: Explicit core count.
            Defaults to None.
